- each component must have its own css file which does not contain any inherited declarations
- each component must contain a class
- each class must have a prefix 'wbyui_'
- the "id" attribute must be empty
- the first class in each component must be the name of the component, example 'wbyui_alert_box'
- the first class inside the component must contain the css "reset" declaration (don't apply the reset on the whole document)
- each component must be created in it's own folder which must contain: html file, css file and optional images folder
- component must behave identically on latest versions of: chrome, firefox, safari, ie and opera
- prefered usage of HTML5 & CSS3
- the flow of designing a component should be
	1. photoshop proposal
